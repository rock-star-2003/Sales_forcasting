My sales forecasting project is built on a dataset containing over **800,000** records. The goal is to analyze past sales data and predict future sales trends based on historical patterns. Given only a limited set of features—**date, item code, item name, unit selling price, and quantity sold**—the challenge was to extract meaningful insights from the available information. By leveraging data science techniques, this model enables forecasting for future dates based on current and past sales trends, offering valuable business insights. The final model achieved **70% accuracy**, making it a reasonably effective tool for predicting sales performance.  

During development, one of the biggest challenges was identifying and engineering the right features. Since most of the essential patterns were hidden within the date column, I focused on extracting relevant time-based attributes such as **day of the week, month, seasonality, and trends**. After multiple iterations of feature selection and evaluation, I compared different attributes to determine their correlation with sales performance. Extensive preprocessing was required to refine the dataset, ensuring that only the most impactful features were used in the model. Despite the limited feature set, careful selection and transformation of data helped improve the model’s predictive capabilities.  

This project was a significant learning experience, as I built it using both my existing knowledge and additional research. While the model has limitations, it reflects my ability to tackle complex problems with a structured approach. The process involved experimenting with various techniques, learning from mistakes, and improving my understanding of **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and sales forecasting models**. Achieving **70% accuracy** with limited data features highlights my ability to extract insights and make data-driven decisions, marking an important step in my journey toward mastering data science and predictive analytics.
